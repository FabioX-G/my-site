I'm sure I wasn't the only student who got bored dissecting the metaphors and symbols used in <em>The Great Gatsby</em> or slogging through a dry history textbook on Mesopotamia and the Byzantine Empire. But over time, a few particular experiences changed my perception of reading entirely.</p><p>When I was 17, I met a friend named Yang from Beijing in Chicago who said I reminded him of a Japanese figure called ‘Toyotomi Hideyoshi 丰臣秀吉.’ I found this comparison strange since I had no idea who Hideyoshi was. So when he sent me a book with the same name a few months later, I couldn't resist my curiosity to figure out who the f*** that person was, and I finished it within a few weeks. That was <strong>the first time I had ever read an entire book cover to cover</strong>. It made me realize that maybe it’s not that we dislike reading itself, but that we haven’t been exposed to <em>the right opportunity to spark our curiosity</em>.</p><div class="image-gallery-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;gallery&quot;:{&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f7c18934-77bf-4930-ad78-060e167fca85_1000x750.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/330a7999-9214-4707-a300-53df231bef2f_402x524.png&quot;}],&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Pic 1 was me and Yang having Peking Duck in Beijing; Pic 2 was his gift for me - the \&quot;丰臣秀吉\&quot; series&quot;,&quot;staticGalleryImage&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/36617994-b00d-4fc1-8b33-9af164be4529_1456x720.png&quot;}},&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}"></div><p>But was curiosity enough? That year, I picked up <em><a href="https://a.co/d/iX9vAG4">Shoe Dog</a></em> by Phil Knight and <em><a href="https://a.co/d/i2unN3e">Zero to One</a></em> by Peter Thiel, but I never made it through either of them. Something was still missing.</p><p>Two years later, on one random summer day, my childhood friend KJ told me he had bought a book that day. Then, the very next day, he casually mentioned he had already finished it yesterday. I was shocked! I could barely get through a book in a whole year, let alone a single day. Then I thought, "If someone who I grew up with can finish a book a day, why can't I?" A week later, I bought a book on traditional Chinese architecture and finished it that day.

He structured the class around book discussions, where we explored topics I was genuinely passionate about.

So I decided to take a gap year to join them there. On the flight from NYC to Bangkok, I picked up Michio Kaku's <em><a href="https://a.co/d/j3eRtNx">Physics of the Future</a></em>. The way Kaku described our exciting future through the lens of physics and chemistry was so clear and profound that it changed my worldview. That was<strong> the first time I truly started looking at the world through atoms and energy. </strong>In the following year, I bought more than a dozen books on physics to continue exploring the universe.</p><div class="image-gallery-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;gallery&quot;:{&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f4c95974-ed5b-4998-902e-2ebc092bcbdb_1000x1778.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bc445d8e-a488-48f8-ac3e-6b888634c31d_1000x750.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f4f30f9a-f2e2-41fa-8af6-418bc65225e8_1000x1333.jpeg&quot;}],&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;staticGalleryImage&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fa0f20fc-cd5d-40ed-be5a-d315aed47b72_1456x474.png&quot;}},&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}"></div><p></p><p>Reflecting on what shifted my attitude from hating to loving&nbsp;to read: (1) a friend who sparked my curiosity with a book series; (2) another friend who triggered me to read better and faster; (3) a mentor who guided me through the process of reading, writing, and speaking, and provided a supportive discussion environment to help me connect the dots; (4) a great popular science book that transformed how I see the world.</p><p>I feel very lucky to have experienced these moments, but they didn't just happen to me. I had to make an effort to read the book Yang sent. I intentionally chose Professor Huber’s GEO430 when I saw it was labeled as ‘reading-intensive.’ And I still had to pick and buy Kaku’s <em>Physics of the Future</em> before that flight from JFK to BKK. I did all this knowing I was a poor reader, but I wanted to give myself more chances before giving up on reading.</p><p>So how do we learn to love something we once hated? Don't get discouraged by bad first encounters. <strong>Give yourself lots and lots of shots.</strong> Expose yourself to new opportunities, and eventually, luck will find you. If not on the second try, then maybe on the tenth.</p><p>Had I given up on reading after my horrible experiences in middle and high school, I would be a completely different person today. And this makes me also wonder:</p><p>how many other things in life have we dismissed too soon just because our first encounter with them was bad?</p><div><hr></div><p>Inspirations of this blog post:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/read.html">The Need to Read</a> by Paul Graham</p></li><li><p><a href="https://nav.al/love-read">Read What You Love Until You Love to Read</a> by Naval Ravikant</p></li></ul>
