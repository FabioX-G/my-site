<p>I want to end this blog with a message from Paul Graham, founder of arguably the best startup accelerator and seed capital firm in the world - Y Combinator:</p><blockquote><p>"Intolerance for ugliness is not in itself enough. You have to understand a field well before you develop a good nose for what needs fixing. You have to do your homework. But as you become expert in a field, you'll start to hear little voices saying, <em>What a hack! There must be a better way.</em> Don't ignore those voices. Cultivate them. <strong>The recipe for great work is: very exacting taste, plus the ability to gratify it.</strong>" (Graham, 2002)</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>The <strong>best</strong> piece of reflection on <strong>taste</strong> that I've ever read is written by Paul Graham in his <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html">Taste for Makers</a> 2002 essay. I would recommend everyone to give it a read.</p>
