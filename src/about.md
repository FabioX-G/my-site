# About Me

- **2024–now**: Building **[Amora Vida Lda.](https://www.amora-vida.com/)** in Portugal 🇵🇹

- **2019–2024**: Studied at Syracuse University 🇺🇸  
    - Majored in *Environment, Sustainability, and Policy* and *Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises*.
    - After junior year, I moved to Thailand 🇹🇭 with my family and spent a year there, before going back to finish my bachelor's degree. 
    - The core business requirements (management/accounting/finance/supply chain/marketing) weren’t very exciting. What I did enjoy were the electives I could choose freely:
        - PHY 314 Quantum Computing Demystified
        - GEO 430 Energy, History, and Society
        - CIS 375 Intro to Discrete Mathematics
        - PSC 478 Politics of China
        - PHI 373 Intro to Philosophy of Science
        - PSC 318 Technology, Politics, and Environment
        - CEE 463 Intro to Sustainable Engineering
        - PSC 300 Governance and Ethics of Artificial Intelligence
    - My favorite part of college was building **[C!ub App](https://youtu.be/RhTEBP59JEs?si=_4Uyx_X4AQcZF4Lk)** with friends during sophomore and junior year.

- **2005–2019**: Grew up in Shanghai, China 🇨🇳  
    - Grade 0: Since my kindergarten in Portugal didn't teach me any Mandarin Chinese or basic arithmetic math (which were the skills required to get into a good primary school in Shanghai), I had to re-do the final year of kindergarten in China. 
    - Grade 1 - 5: 上海世界外国语小学(境外部) World Foreign Language Primary Sschool (WFLPS), 
    - Grade 6 - 7: 上海世界外国语中学(双语部) World Foreign Language Middle Sschool (WFLMS), 
    - Grade 8 - 9: 上海中学(国际部) Shanghai High School Internatinal Division (SHSID), and 
    - Grade 10 - 12: 上海美国学校(浦西) Shanghai American School (SAS - Puxi Campus). 
    - My favorite part of high school was starting the **[Shanghai High-School Soccer Association (SHSA) League](/posts/soccer/)**, which brought together students from different high schools across the city to play and compete.

- **2000**: Born in Lisbon, Portugal 🇵🇹 (and finished kindergarten there.)
