Unfortunately, many people falsely apply this to the process of their work. And mistakenly think that if they can just spend a lot of time and effort on that one thing, they would have a higher chance of producing great work.</p><p>Obviously producing 1 masterpiece is better than producing 10 pieces of average work. We all know that. But can you really produce a masterpiece by being laser-focused on that one piece of work and working on it for a long time?</p><p>History says otherwise, as demonstrated in Adam Grant's book <em>Originals </em>(Grant, 35-37):</p><ul><li><p>In the world of <strong>literature and operas</strong>, most people only know a few classics from <em>Shakespeare</em>, such as <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> and <em>Hamlet</em>. But what people ignore is that he produced 37 plays and 154 sonnets within 2 decades. And he created most of his best plays AND worst plays in the same five-year period.</p></li><li><p>In the world of <strong>classical</strong> <strong>music</strong>, <em>Mozart</em> composed more than 600 pieces before he died at the age of 35, <em>Beethoven</em> produced around 650 in his lifetime, and <em>Bach</em> produced over a thousand... Yet only a handful of their work is considered masterpieces.</p></li><li><p>In the world of <strong>technological innovations</strong>, most people deem <em>Thomas Edison</em> as the genius that came up with the incandescent lightbulb and the carbon telephone. But in the same period, he actually filed more than one hundred patents. Most of which had minor impacts compared to the light bulbs.</p></li><li><p>In the world of <strong>scientific discoveries</strong>, <em>Albert Einstein</em> is well-known for his work on general and special relativity that revolutionized physics. But most of his 248 publications had minimal impact compared to his relativity theories.</p></li><li><p>In the world of <strong>art and paintings</strong>, <em>Picasso</em> produced more than 1800 paintings, 1200 sculptures, 2800 ceramics, and 12000 drawings over his lifetime.</p></li></ul><p>I also found other real-life examples in different fields:</p><ul><li><p>In the world of <strong>product design</strong>,<em> Jony Ive</em>, the Chief Design Officer (CDO) of Apple for over two decades, played a vital role in the design of the iMac G3, iPod, iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and Apple Watch. But before this, he designed hearing aids, sinks, microwave ovens, toilets, bidets, drills, and toothbrushes...

Quality is important. But the way to achieve high <strong>quality</strong> is through high <strong>quantity</strong>. And these two words are not mutually exclusive. Producing a high quantity of "work" doesn't mean producing a high quantity of "shit work". The notion of "quantity over quality" is that you should continue creating more and more things, regardless of the quality of your work. On the contrary, the notion of "quality over quantity" becomes an excuse for people to do less work, reducing a person's probability of producing masterpieces in the long run.</p><div><hr></div><p>Thanks to Bryce Yao, Kelvin Mo, Mike Kong, Jan-Michael Marshall, Ivy Wu, Rich Chuang, Raymond Yip, Daphne Chao, Jonron Kogawa, and Courtney Qi for reading drafts of this.</p><div><hr></div><p>Reference:</p><p>Grant, A.
