I'm sure I wasn't the only student who got bored dissecting the metaphors and symbols used in <em>The Great Gatsby</em> or slogging through a dry history textbook on Mesopotamia and the Byzantine Empire. But over time, a few particular experiences changed my perception of reading entirely.</p><p>When I was 17, I met a friend named Yang from Beijing in Chicago who said I reminded him of a Japanese figure called ‘Toyotomi Hideyoshi 丰臣秀吉.’ I found this comparison strange since I had no idea who Hideyoshi was. So when he sent me a book with the same name a few months later, I couldn't resist my curiosity to figure out who the f*** that person was, and I finished it within a few weeks. That was <strong>the first time I had ever read an entire book cover to cover</strong>. It made me realize that maybe it’s not that we dislike reading itself, but that we haven’t been exposed to <em>the right opportunity to spark our curiosity</em>.</p><figure class="substack-gallery-fallback"><a class="substack-image-open" href="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/36617994-b00d-4fc1-8b33-9af164be4529_1456x720.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/36617994-b00d-4fc1-8b33-9af164be4529_1456x720.png" alt="Pic 1 was me and Yang having Peking Duck in Beijing; Pic 2 was his gift for me - the &quot;丰臣秀吉&quot; series" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /></a></figure><p>But was curiosity enough? That year, I picked up <em><a href="https://a.co/d/iX9vAG4">Shoe Dog</a></em> by Phil Knight and <em><a href="https://a.co/d/i2unN3e">Zero to One</a></em> by Peter Thiel, but I never made it through either of them. Something was still missing.</p><p>Two years later, on one random summer day, my childhood friend KJ told me he had bought a book that day. Then, the very next day, he casually mentioned he had already finished it yesterday. I was shocked! I could barely get through a book in a whole year, let alone a single day. Then I thought, "If someone who I grew up with can finish a book a day, why can't I?" A week later, I bought a book on traditional Chinese architecture and finished it that day. That was <strong>the first time I finished a book in one single sitting</strong>.</p><figure class="substack-gallery-fallback"><a class="substack-image-open" href="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5e55ca1c-3f38-4c42-aca4-ef70bf7d45c5_1456x474.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5e55ca1c-3f38-4c42-aca4-ef70bf7d45c5_1456x474.png" alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /></a><figcaption>Pic 1+2: KJ, Daphne, Rich, and I were having sushi for lunch in NYC. Pic 3 was the Chinese architecture book.</figcaption></figure><p>I realized that developing a love for something requires more than just curiosity—it also requires the <em>right environment and people</em> who push you in that direction.</p><p>At 21, I took a course called <em>GEO430: Energy, History, and Society</em> with Professor <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/matthew-t-huber">Matt Huber</a>. He structured the class around book discussions, where we explored topics I was genuinely passionate about. Most of the talking was done by students, based on the readings and the 1000-word essays we wrote before each class. That was<strong> the first time I felt a deep connection between reading, writing, and speaking</strong>.</p><figure class="substack-gallery-fallback"><a class="substack-image-open" href="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a2b06c59-e307-4cbb-b34d-e292f96421f9_1456x964.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a2b06c59-e307-4cbb-b34d-e292f96421f9_1456x964.png" alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /></a><figcaption>These were the books we had to read for GEO 430 class and be ready to discuss at 155 Eggers Hall.</figcaption></figure><p>And because every class we need to talk so much, it made me realize:</p><ul><li><p>To speak and debate well, you need to think well.</p></li><li><p>To think well, you need to <a href="https://fabio-xie.ghost.io/essay/">write</a> well.</p></li><li><p>To write well, you need to read well.</p></li></ul><p>This realization of how foundational reading is for clear thinking makes me want to spend more time on reading.</p><p>The <a href="https://fabio-xie.ghost.io/2022-summer/">summer</a> after my junior year, my entire family moved to Thailand. So I decided to take a gap year to join them there. On the flight from NYC to Bangkok, I picked up Michio Kaku's <em><a href="https://a.co/d/j3eRtNx">Physics of the Future</a></em>. The way Kaku described our exciting future through the lens of physics and chemistry was so clear and profound that it changed my worldview. That was<strong> the first time I truly started looking at the world through atoms and energy. </strong>In the following year, I bought more than a dozen books on physics to continue exploring the universe.</p><figure class="substack-gallery-fallback"><a class="substack-image-open" href="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fa0f20fc-cd5d-40ed-be5a-d315aed47b72_1456x474.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fa0f20fc-cd5d-40ed-be5a-d315aed47b72_1456x474.png" alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /></a></figure><p></p><p>Reflecting on what shifted my attitude from hating to loving&nbsp;to read: (1) a friend who sparked my curiosity with a book series; (2) another friend who triggered me to read better and faster; (3) a mentor who guided me through the process of reading, writing, and speaking, and provided a supportive discussion environment to help me connect the dots; (4) a great popular science book that transformed how I see the world.</p><p>I feel very lucky to have experienced these moments, but they didn't just happen to me. I had to make an effort to read the book Yang sent. I intentionally chose Professor Huber’s GEO430 when I saw it was labeled as ‘reading-intensive.’ And I still had to pick and buy Kaku’s <em>Physics of the Future</em> before that flight from JFK to BKK. I did all this knowing I was a poor reader, but I wanted to give myself more chances before giving up on reading.</p><p>So how do we learn to love something we once hated? Don't get discouraged by bad first encounters. <strong>Give yourself lots and lots of shots.</strong> Expose yourself to new opportunities, and eventually, luck will find you. If not on the second try, then maybe on the tenth.</p><p>Had I given up on reading after my horrible experiences in middle and high school, I would be a completely different person today. And this makes me also wonder:</p><p>how many other things in life have we dismissed too soon just because our first encounter with them was bad?</p><div><hr></div><p>Inspirations of this blog post:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/read.html">The Need to Read</a> by Paul Graham</p></li><li><p><a href="https://nav.al/love-read">Read What You Love Until You Love to Read</a> by Naval Ravikant</p></li></ul>
