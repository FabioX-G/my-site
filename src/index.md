# Welcome to my site!

This is Fabio.

Born in Lisbon ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹, grew up in Shanghai ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, studied at Syracuse University ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, lived in Thailand ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ for a whileâ€¦ and now Iâ€™m back in Portugal to work at **[Amora Vida](https://www.amora-vida.com/)**. (More [about me](/about/))

I share my [thoughts](/blog/) here from time to time to think and reflect.

In my free time, I enjoy reading nonfiction [books](/library/), training [Muay Thai](https://youtu.be/b-5bljm8tSk), playing soccer, [interviewing](https://youtu.be/034gmmUK8vc) friends, vibe-coding this personal website of mine, and spending time with my 10-year-old brother [Jason](https://youtu.be/dF_8LnEW9QU?si=Wl7bBf9lCH_KhuzK) (we play Brawl Stars & FC Mobile, brainstorm about his new novels, and read comic books before bedtime).
