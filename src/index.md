# Welcome to my site!

This is Fabio. I currently live in Portugal and work at **[Amora Vida](https://www.amora-vida.com/)**.

Born in Lisbon ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹, grew up in Shanghai ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, studied at Syracuse University ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, lived in Thailand ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ for a whileâ€¦ and now Iâ€™m back in Portugal. (More [about me](/about/))

I share my [thoughts](/blog/) here from time to time to think and reflect.

In my free time, I enjoy reading nonfiction [books](/library/), training Muay Thai, playing soccer, vibe-coding this personal website of mine, and spending time with my 10-year-old brother Jason (we play Brawl Stars & FC Mobile, and read comics before bedtime).
