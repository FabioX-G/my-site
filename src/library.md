# Bookshelf

Welcome to my digital bookshelf!

For a long time, school tricked me into thinking reading was a chore. I've since found the antidote: 

> follow your own curiosity relentlessly.

This digital bookshelf is the result of that philosophy. It is a living catalog of (most of) my physical books, guided by whatever subject interests me most at any given moment.

To help you navigate, I've color-coded my recommendations:

  - Orange: Personal favorites that drastically changed how I see the world. These books are either unusually dense with insights or contain a single, transformative idea that provides a new model for the world. These are the rare books whose lessons have stuck with me long after reading.

  - Green: Strong recommendations that are well worth reading (and re-reading).

  - Blue: Everything else I've found interesting.

The book titles are links that will take you to the Amazon page for the edition I own.

#### I hope you find something below that sparks your interest too!
